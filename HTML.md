## The History of HTML
HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in `1989`. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

`HTML is a Hypertext markup language` that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
* Hypertext:- "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
* Markup :- HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as  <title>, </title> and many others.
