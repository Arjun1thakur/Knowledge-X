## The History of HTML
* HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in `1989`. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
* Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
* A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
### `HTML is a Hypertext markup language` that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
* Hypertext:- "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
* Markup :- HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as  <title>, </title> and many others.
