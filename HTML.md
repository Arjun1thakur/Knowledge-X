***<h1 align="center">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h1>***

## ***The History of HTML***
***HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in `1989`. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.***

***`HTML is a Hypertext markup language` that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.***
* ***Hypertext:- "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.***
* ***Markup :- HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as  <title>, </title> and many others.***

## ***Q2. What is the <!DOCTYPE>?***
***It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.***
## ***Q3. What is the &lt;html&gt;?***
***It's a root element of an HTML page. This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. Text between html tag describes the web document. It is a container for all other elements of HTML except <!DOCTYPE>.***

## ***Q4. What is the HTML head?***
***`The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.`***

***This is where all the metadata for the page goes â€” stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.***

***The HTML head is the contents of the `<head>` element. Unlike the contents of the `<body>` element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document***

## ***Q4. What is the &lt;meta&gt;?***
***This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.***

***The `<meta>` element holds information about your page that you want other computers to understand. The contents of this element will not be printed on the page, and are not known to the human reader. They are designed to aid with categorization, search engine indexing and browser behavior.***
